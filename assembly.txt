[value] := Either a integer or a quoted string
[word]   := unquoted text

Machine registers
---------------------------------------------
Certain instructions will set various register flags.
These flags are set by the 'test' and 'testim' instructions

Z: The zero flag
    Used by 'jumpz', 'jumpltz', 'jumpgtz'
GT: Greater then zero
    'jumpgt', 'jumpgtz'
LT: Less then zero
    'jumplt', 'jumpltz'

HALT: Halt the machine
    Set by the 'halt' instruction

Data instructions
--------------------------------
push [value]
    Push the value to the top of the stack
pop
    Pop a value from the top of stack. The value
    is discarded

load [word]
    Push a value stored with the given name into the
    top of stack

store [word]
    Store the value at the top of stack into the given
    named location. The value is popped from the stack

Test and compare
------------------------------------------------
test
    Compare the top two values on the stack and set
    the LT, Z or GT register flags. The stack remains
    unchanged.

testim [value]
    Compare the top value on the stack with the immediate
    value and set the LT, Z or GT register flags.
    The stack remains unchanged.
