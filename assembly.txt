[value] := Either a integer or a quoted string

Machine registers
---------------------------------------------
Certain instructions will set various register flags.
These flags are set by the 'test' and 'testim' instructions

EQ: The equality flag
    Used by 'jumpe', 'jumplte', 'jumpgte'
GT: Greater than
    'jumpgt', 'jumpgte'
LT: Less than
    'jumplt', 'jumplte'

HALT: Halt the machine
    Set by the 'halt' instruction

Data instructions
--------------------------------
push [value]
    Push the value to the top of the stack
pop
    Pop a value from the top of stack. The value
    is discarded.

    Throws: std::exception if stack is empty

load name
    Push a value stored with the given name into the
    top of stack

store name
    Store the value at the top of stack into the given
    named location. The value is popped from the stack.

    Throws: std::exception if stack is empty

Test and compare
------------------------------------------------
test
    Compare the top two values on the stack and set
    the LT, EQ or GT register flags. The stack remains
    unchanged.

    Throws: std::exception if stack does not have two values.
    Throws: std::exception if the value are not the same type.

testim [value]
    Compare the top value on the stack with the immediate
    value and set the LT, EQ or GT register flags.
    The stack remains unchanged.

    Throws: std::exception if stack is empty
    Throws: std::exception if the values are not the same type.
